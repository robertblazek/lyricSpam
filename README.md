# lyricSpam
 #### Basic Python lyrics spammer.

Just get the lyrics and paste it in the `lyrics.txt` file. Each word is sent individually. You get 10 seconds to get a text field in focus. After every word, the `[ENTER]` key is pressed to send the message.

## Dependencies
You need __Python__ and the `pyautogui` library. [\(Install it here\)](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#)

I don't take any responsibility for what is being done with this script.
